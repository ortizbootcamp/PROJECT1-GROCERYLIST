WIP App Name: Grocer-E

As a... shopper who is the head-of-household

I want... a grocery list app that allows me to keep track of the items I need and allow family members to collaborate and add their wanted items as well

So that... grocery shopping for the family can be collaborative, all inclusive, and simplified
