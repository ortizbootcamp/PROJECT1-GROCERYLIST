# PROJECT1-GROCERYLIST

Grocer-E is a simple grocery app where multiple users can add items needed from the grocery store to a single list. Unsure what to make for dinner? This app will generate a random recipe to choose from so that you can view the recipe and ingredients needed so that you can add them to your list all in one place.

As a shopper who does the grocery shopping

I want a grocery list app that allows me to keep track of the items I need and allow family members to collaborate and add their wanted items and given nutritional facts about the food Iâ€™m buying, I would also like recipe suggestions.

So that grocery shopping for the family can be collaborative, all inclusive, and simplified
